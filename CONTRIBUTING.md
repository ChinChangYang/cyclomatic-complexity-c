# Contributing to Cyclomatic Complexity Calculator for C - Visual Studio Code Extension

Thank you for considering a contribution to the Cyclomatic Complexity Calculator for C. We appreciate your help and have outlined some guidelines to make the process easier and more effective.

## Key Focus Areas

We would love contributions in the following areas:

1. Implement in-memory or unsaved file real-time cyclomatic complexity calculation.
2. Ensure cross-platform compatibility of the C++ program that calculates the cyclomatic complexity.
3. Create more test cases to identify edge cases where the cyclomatic complexity calculation may be inaccurate.
4. Improve the cyclomatic complexity calculation to better handle edge cases, such as "&&", "||", and "?:" operations.

## Code Style and Conventions

We recommend using a code formatter or linter to maintain consistent code style. For TypeScript, consider using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). For C++, consider using [Clang-Format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).

Before you submit a pull request, please ensure your code adheres to these styles.
