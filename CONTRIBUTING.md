# Contributing to Cyclomatic Complexity Calculator for C - Visual Studio Code Extension

Thank you for considering contributing to the Cyclomatic Complexity Calculator for C. Your help is greatly valued! We've outlined some guidelines below to facilitate a smoother contribution process.

## Key Focus Areas

We warmly welcome contributions in the following areas:

1. **Ensuring cross-platform compatibility** of the C++ program that calculates the cyclomatic complexity. This includes seamless execution on different operating systems and configurations.
2. **Creation of extensive test cases** to identify edge cases where the cyclomatic complexity calculation might be inaccurate. This helps us ensure the robustness and reliability of our tool.
3. **Enhancement of the cyclomatic complexity calculation algorithm** to better handle edge cases, such as "&&", "||", and "?:" operations.

## Code Style and Conventions

Consistent code style is critical to maintain the readability and maintainability of the project. We encourage the use of a code formatter or linter:

- For TypeScript, consider using [ESLint](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-eslint).
- For C++, consider using [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools).

Ensure your contributions adhere to these styles before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting Changes

Please follow these steps to submit changes:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch specific to your feature or fix.
2. Develop your feature or bug fix, ideally incorporating new test cases when relevant.
3. Ensure your code adheres to our style and convention guidelines.
4. Submit a pull request against our repository. In the pull request description, detail your changes, their implications, and any testing methods you've employed.

When submitting bug fixes, please include a test case that reproduces the bug to help us understand and integrate your solution effectively.
